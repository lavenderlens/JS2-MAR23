      /**
       * curryine is to take a function that takes multiple args
       * and convert it into a HOF that accepts just one arg
       * where the other args are known
       * why??
       * because lookup time is more performant with less args
       *
       * it may be helpful to think of this as the opposite to rest parameters, at least conceptually
       * rest packs zero, one, or many args to an array inside a function
       * currying takes many args and creates multiple functions that reuire only one arg each
       *
       * examples, real world, could include
       * calculating the volume of 3D shapes, area of 2D, where side lengths are already known
       * outputting views of music track data such as length
       * when combinations of eg artist, album, track are already known
       *
       *in summary, currying is of use where we wish to distill a function that accepts n args
       into n funcs that each accept only 1 arg (where the others are known)
       * */
